## Android Projects

### Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

#### TodoList - Created Nov. 2015 (Updated 2016)

- It contains an add button and delete all button

- Enter a yes or no question
- Tap the Magic 8 with your finger to receive a random answer
- If the Magic 8 is tapped while the entry field is blank, a question prompt will appear.
